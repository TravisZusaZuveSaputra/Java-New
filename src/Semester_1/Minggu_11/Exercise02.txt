What are the x- and y-coordinates of the Points referred to as p1, p2, and p3
after the following code executes? Give tour answer as an x-y pair such as
(0,0). (Recall that Points and other objects use reference semantics)

Point p1 = new Point();
p1.x = 17;
p1.y = 9;
Point p2 = new Point();
p2.x = 4;
p2.y = -1;
Point p3 = p2;

p1.translate(3, 1);
p2.x = 50;
p3.translate(-4, 5);

>> p1: (20, 10)
>> p2: (46, 4)
>> p3: (46, 4)
